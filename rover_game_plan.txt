 1. Operating System
    Build a custom Linux distribution for the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC on the TE0802.
 2. ROS2 - Middleware
    Configure environment and necessary packages.
 3. Drivers and SDKs
   Vision Sensor SDKs
     Intel RealSense SDK 2.0 or ZED SDK.
   LiDAR Sensor Drivers
     ROS packages for RPLIDAR.
   Motor Controller Drivers
     ROS control or custom drivers if needed.
 4. Vision Algorithms
   Obstacle Detection
     Use depth data for identifying obstacles; apply filtering and segmentation.
   SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
     rtabmap_ros or cartographer_ros.
   Object Recognition (Future)
     Potentially utilize hardware acceleration on the TE0802â€™s FPGA fabric or upgrade to VCK190 if advanced AI is needed.
 5. Navigation Algorithms
    Path Planning: A* or Dijkstra for global planning.
    Local Obstacle Avoidance: DWA, TEB, or other ROS local planners.
 6. Control Systems
    Motion Control
      PID control for precise actuator movements.
    Feedback Systems
      Use encoder data and IMU readings in closed-loop control.
 7. User Interface
   Monitoring Dashboard
     Use RViz, rqt, or custom GUIs.
   Remote Control Interface
     Teleoperation packages or web-based tools.
